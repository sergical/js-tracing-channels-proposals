Ecosystem coverage model for the TracingChannel initiative.

Fair single-number methodology (see TRACKER.md > Ecosystem Coverage):
  - Denominator = whole ecosystem, ALL versions (weekly npm downloads).
  - Numerator   = only downloads on CHANNEL-CAPABLE versions (the release that
                  introduced the channel, and later). This is real adoption,
                  not "exists upstream" — it self-corrects for version lag.
  - Two numbers + diff:
      Number 1 = covered WITHOUT Sentry        (baseline the ecosystem reached on its own)
      Number 2 = covered WITH Sentry's merges
      DIFF     = Number 2 - Number 1           = Sentry's measurable effect today
  - Ceiling   = Sentry libs at FULL adoption (all installs on a capable version),
                i.e. the payoff still in flight as users upgrade.

Run:  python3 scripts/coverage.py            # prints the markdown block + numbers
      python3 scripts/coverage.py --write     # also rewrites the section in TRACKER.md

Maintenance: when a new channel merges, add the library to COVERED with the
version that introduced it and who drove it. When one is still tracked but has
no channel, leave it out of COVERED (it stays in the denominator via ECOSYSTEM).
Re-run monthly; download numbers drift.
